Assignment 2
===============

A group of 20 students studied 0 to 6 hours for the exam.  Some passed and others failed. Results are given below (Data is taken from Wikipedia).

| Student | Hours studied  - x | Result (0 – fail, 1 – pass) - y |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 0.5 | 0 |
| 2 | 0.75 | 0 |
| 3 | 1.00 | 0 |
| 4 | 1.25 | 0 |
| 5 | 1.50 | 0 |
| 6 | 1.75 | 0 |
| 7 | 1.75 | 1 |
| 8 | 2.00 | 0 |
| 9 | 2.25 | 1 |
| 10 | 2.50 | 0 |
| 11 | 2.75 | 1 |
| 12 | 3.00 | 0 |
| 13 | 3.25 | 1 |
| 14 | 3.50 | 0 |
| 15 | 4.00 | 1 |
| 16 | 4.25 | 1 |
| 17 | 4.50 | 1 |
| 18 | 4.75 | 1 |
| 19 | 5.00 | 1 |
| 20 | 5.50 | 1 |

1. Determine the optimal linear hypothesis using linear regression to predict if a student passes or not based on the number hours studied.
2. Determine the optimal logistic hypothesis using logistic regression to predict if a student passes or not based on the number hours studied.
3. Plot both hypothesis function 0 &lt; x &lt; 6. Compare and explain the two results obtained.
4. Develop a logistic regression-like algorithm for the following cost function.
    Y = 1 - Cost function goes from 100 to 0 linearly as hypothesis function goes from 0 to 1
    Y = 0 - Cost function goes from 0 to 100 linearly as hypothesis function goes from 0 to 1
Compare results with those of the standard logistic algorithm.


Assignment 3
============

1. You are given 21 well distributed training pattern of dimensionality 3.
    1. What is the probability that a linear classifier separates a randomly selected dichotomy of training patterns?
    2.  What is the minimum degree polynomial function that guarantees separation of any dichotomy of 21 sample patterns?
2. You are given training patterns {X1 , .  .  .  .  , XN} from both classes. All patterns are augmented by 1 and patterns 
of Class-2 are multiplied by -1 as discussed in the class.  The cost function
    J(θ) = ∑ # I = 1 to N (1/X # i # t X # i) [| θ # t X # i | # 2 | θ # t X # i | θ # t X # i ]
attains its only minimum value of zero if θ # t X # i &gt; 0 for all X # i.  Develop a machine learning algorithm based on gradient
descent approach to learn θ from training data to separate the two classes.

3. You are given the following training data.
    Class1: (2  4) # t , (3  3) # t
    Class2: (6 12) # t , (8  10) # t
