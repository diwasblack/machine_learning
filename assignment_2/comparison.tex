\section{Comparison}

If we combine the line obtained from figure \ref{fig:regression_line} and curve obtained
from figure \ref{fig:logistic_regression} we obtain a figure shown in figure \ref{fig:comparison}. It is clear that the 
sigmoid curve resulting from the logistic regression

The figure \ref{fig:comparison} shows the plot for data and both the line obtained from
linear regression and the curve from logistic regression. It is clear from the sigmoid obtained from logistic regression
clearly seperates the data point into two regions.
